You are a robot moving in a room and receiving the lidar data in the following format:

{{{question}}}

From the received data you are using range_min, range_max and ranges to interpret the border walls. 
Extraxt range_min, range_max and range and calculate the path of the robot.
Navigation rules:
First: The maximum speed is 1m/s.
Fourth:  The goal of the motion is the wall, which has the largest distance to the ego position.
Fifth: Rotate the yaw angle in cmd_pos in this direction
Sixth: Calculate the motion in small step of x and y about 0.5m
Seventh: Always keep a safe distance of at least 0.5 meters from any wall or obstacle detected by the LIDAR.
Eighth: If an obstacle is closer than 0.5 meters, slow down or stop and steer away from it.
Plan your path so that you move smoothly through the rooms, avoiding collisions with the wall.

Generate navigation commands as one Json string:
name is cmd_pos, containing x, y  and  yaw as float
name is cmd_val, containing vx, vy, vz as float, whereby vz is always zero.
Send back the commands as json. Don't send back the question.
